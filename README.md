# An external trainer for Assault Cube written in Rust, based on GuidedHacking

### Why Rust?
I like Rust and I haven't seen it done before.

### Overview
This is a pretty simple external trainer. It gives a player...
* Infinite ammo
* Infinite health
* Disable recoil
* Disable weapon spread
* Maximum fire rate
A use can configure these with a simple checkbox GUI.

### Usability
It works pretty well, but is only meant as a proof of concept for game memory manipulation in Rust. This does not make an effort to bypass any anti cheat
solutions or provide more advanced features, like ESP or aimbot.
